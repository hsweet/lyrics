</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>(Ogden Nash)<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black><BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>I'm an autocratic figure in these democratic states<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>A dandy demonstration of hereditary traits.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>As the children of the baker make the most delicious breads<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>And the sons of Casanova fill the most exclusive beds,<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>And the Barrymores and Roosevelts and others I could name<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>Inherited the features that perpetuate their fame,<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>My position in the structure of society I owe<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>To the qualities my parents bequeathed me long ago.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>Now, my father was a gentleman, and musical, to boot;<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>He used to play piano in a house of ill repute.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>My mother was the madam, and a credit to her cult<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>She liked my daddy's playing, and I was the result.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>So my mammy and my daddy are the ones I've got to thank,<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>I'm the chairman of the board of the National City Bank.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black><BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>cho: Our parents forgot to get married<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>     Our parents forgot to get wed;<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>     Did a wedding bell chime, that was always a time<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>     They were somewhere off in bed.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>     So it's thanks to our kind-hearted parents<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>     We're kings in this land of the free<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>     The banker, the broker, the Washington joker<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>     Three prominent bastards are we.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black><BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>In a cozy little cottage, in a cozy little dell<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>A dear old-fashioned farmer and his daughter used to dwell.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>She was pretty, she was charming, she was tender, she was mild<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>And her sympathies were such that she was frequently with child.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>The year her hospitality attained a record high<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>She found herself the mother of an infant, which was I.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>And whenever she was gloomy I could always make her grin<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>By childishly inquiring who my daddy might have been.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>Now the hired man was favored by the gals of mammy's set<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>And the traveling man from Scranton was an even-money bet,<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>But such were mammy motives, and such was her allure<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>That even Roger Babson wasn't altogether sure.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>So I took my mammy's morals and I took my daddy's crust<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>And I grew to be the founder of a big investment trust.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black><BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>On a dusty southern chain-gang, on a dusty southern road<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>My late-lamented pappy made his permanent abode,<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>Now while some was there for stealing, my pappy's only fault<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>Was an overwhelming weakness for criminal assault.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>His philosophy was simple, and free of moral tape,<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>"Seduction is for sissies; a he-man wants his rape!"<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>Pappy's total list of victims was embarrassingly rich<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>And though one of them was mammy, still he could not tell me which.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>Well I never went to college, but I got me a degree,<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>I guess I am the model of a perfect S.O.B,<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>I'm a debit to my country, but a credit to my dad,<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>The most expensive senator this country ever had.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>I remember pappy's telling me, "Boy, rapin' is a crime<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>Unless you rape the voters, a million at a time."<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black><BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>I'm an ordinary figure in these democratic states,<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>A pathetic demonstration of hereditary traits.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>As the children of the cops possess the flattest kind of feet<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>And the daughter of the floozie has a waggle to seat,<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>My position in the basement of society I owe<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>To the qualities my parents bequeathed me long ago.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>Now, my father was a married man, and what is even more<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>He was married to my mother, a fact that I deplore<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>I was born in holy wedlock, consequently bye and bye<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>I got rooked by every bastard with plunder in his eye.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>I invested, I deposited, I voted every fall<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>Did I ever get a penny saved, those bastards took it all.<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>Well, at last I've learned my lesson, and I'm on the proper track<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR=Black>I'm a self-appointed bastard, and I'm gonna get it back.<BR>
